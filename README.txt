Designed and implemented a retail point-of-sale system that used COBOL and DB2 to manage sales, inventory, and customer data.

Skills included designing the system architecture, developing and testing the COBOL code, and integrating the system with the DB2 database.

The retail point-of-sale system provided a user-friendly interface for store employees to manage inventory, process sales, and view customer data. The system was designed to scale to accommodate the needs of a large retail operation with multiple store locations.
